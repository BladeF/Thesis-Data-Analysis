There were too many options. I would give up and just type answer,Not being able to find what I wanted fast enough. I just made everything short and sweet.,Help was easy to find,It takes a long time and people feel impatient,not have to use voice to communicate,hard to find options
"To many options on screen, I felt overwhelmed constantly and throughout the duration of the test would discover new options I didn't realize existed such as the word ""this"". Furthermore, some words or concepts I felt could be in many places, such as ""snack"" could be under eat, need, or feel (as in I feel hungry). The amount of options made it harder to find what I needed. The color pattern system also was confusing, especially when different colors such as light yellow appeared in many places. If there are meant to be together, then they should be grouped together. I also mostly focused on the upper left hand side of the screen as this is where I thought most of the common and important functionality would be. Not finding the expected functionality where I needed it to be made me frustrated and made me feel more lost and confused.","What limited my thoughts was just knowledge of the system, throughout the study I kept discovering and losing key items. Early on I commented on the system not having the word ""this"" until I found it later. At one point I found the word ""Zombie"" but was unable to find it again when looking to talk about movies. Some of the icons are either confusing or highly misleading. For example, need shows a man imagining a toilet yet there is no toilet option and almost all of the needs are related to religion. This complexity and confusing icons plus words not being in the right place made the software extremely hard to use. Given enough time, I could be able to learn the system better but I never feel that I could master it. ","Requests such as going to the bathroom and asking for help with math were almost impossible. This is in part due to the a fore mentioned confusing layout, my lack of knowledge with the system, I also don't believe some of these words exist within the system. After all this time I still have no idea where the word toilet or bathroom is, I can find toilet paper and Catheter just fine. While it is technically possible, this is incredibly frustrating to use and not preferable by any standard.","Conversations are extremely fragmented. It is hard to find action words and connect thoughts together. This leaves every sentence being disjoint and feeling broken. If I didn't have the prompt and just heard some of the lines I created, I would be deeply confused as to what point is being made.",It is better then using nothing or attempting to play charades every time you want something.,"The entire thing feels almost unusable. Nothing is where it is suppose to be or should be. Related items are in different categories. All options manage to feel to specific or to vague so I could next properly communicate what I wanted to. Icons such don't make any sense. Why is ""accident"" a plane crashing? Why is ""Need"" a man thinking of a toilet then only have religious stuff? Where even is the actual toilet option anyways? Why does ""play"" not have a computer or video game option? Why are the icons laid out in a such a confusing way? What is the color pallet suppose to mean? Why does shrinking the page shrink all the Icons and make everything even more unusable. Above all, i'd say the worst part is that some people are forced to communicate and rely on this thing. "
It negatively affected my ability to communicate because of the large number of items,"The color grouping was helpful, but sometimes guessing which items may lay behind the quarter circle groupings was frustrating ",The help and question icons were clearly identifiable ,Some extraneous icons were either difficult to find or not present,The color grouping on the main page.,Some of the organization of the quarter circle sub tabs
"It was challenging to find certain words or word categories.  It was stressful, because I felt like I was not answering fast enough.",Putting the words/word categories in alphabetical order,It would take too long for me to communicate that way.,It would take too long for me to be able to reply during a conversayion,The variety of words and word categories.,Difficulty navigating and finding words/word categories.
There was a lot to look for. I think that if there was section for most commonly used that would be helpful such as bathroom,"It was hard for me to look at all of the items on the screen, I got distracted and sometimes overwhelmed by looking at them all",The help button was clear. Maybe there should be an icon at the top with needing help with the device ,I like that you are able to type if you cant find a word. i think that makes it personable ,I liked the photos that each icon had. I like that it speaks my sentence loudly when the bar is clicked. I was able to get my point across I also really enjoyed the typing feature. It was easier to communicate something super specific such as the breadstick question,the different colors and the number of icons kind of threw me off. It was also sometimes difficult to find the cue. for example when I clicked the help I was expecting it to be in the top left when I clicked the icon but it took me to a new screen and I found myself looking for it. I think it would be neat to have the voice that reads more human-like if that was possible. Other than that I enjoyed the device 
A little overwhelming at the start,"Difficult to find exact words, had to manually type most items.",Specific requests require typing but the general format of the sentence can be made with the pregenerated buttons,"I am not used to the tool, but it is slow and cumbersome. Plus there is no option to store custom words, so I would have to type the same thing over and over again by hand.",Pictures help with visually locating the relevant button or sub-group,My lack of knowledge of the tool and what would be classified under a particular heading. e.x. what goes under the give vs use headings.
