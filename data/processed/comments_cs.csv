I had trouble finding the basic structural words of a sentence.,"A lot of regularly used words were on the main page, however I feel that some words that weren't on the main screen were too difficult to find. The other things that limited my ability was that some categories for words didn't make any sense. ",When asking for help I would only respond vaguely because I  couldn't find the words that I needed.,I could use the tool but it would take way too long for me to type a sentence.,When the category tabs had words inside of them that made sense. ,There are too many images on the screen at one time. 
"To many options on screen, I felt overwhelmed constantly and throughout the duration of the test would discover new options I didn't realize existed such as the word ""this"". Furthermore, some words or concepts I felt could be in many places, such as ""snack"" could be under eat, need, or feel (as in I feel hungry). The amount of options made it harder to find what I needed. The color pattern system also was confusing, especially when different colors such as light yellow appeared in many places. If there are meant to be together, then they should be grouped together. I also mostly focused on the upper left hand side of the screen as this is where I thought most of the common and important functionality would be. Not finding the expected functionality where I needed it to be made me frustrated and made me feel more lost and confused.","What limited my thoughts was just knowledge of the system, throughout the study I kept discovering and losing key items. Early on I commented on the system not having the word ""this"" until I found it later. At one point I found the word ""Zombie"" but was unable to find it again when looking to talk about movies. Some of the icons are either confusing or highly misleading. For example, need shows a man imagining a toilet yet there is no toilet option and almost all of the needs are related to religion. This complexity and confusing icons plus words not being in the right place made the software extremely hard to use. Given enough time, I could be able to learn the system better but I never feel that I could master it. ","Requests such as going to the bathroom and asking for help with math were almost impossible. This is in part due to the a fore mentioned confusing layout, my lack of knowledge with the system, I also don't believe some of these words exist within the system. After all this time I still have no idea where the word toilet or bathroom is, I can find toilet paper and Catheter just fine. While it is technically possible, this is incredibly frustrating to use and not preferable by any standard.","Conversations are extremely fragmented. It is hard to find action words and connect thoughts together. This leaves every sentence being disjoint and feeling broken. If I didn't have the prompt and just heard some of the lines I created, I would be deeply confused as to what point is being made.",It is better then using nothing or attempting to play charades every time you want something.,"The entire thing feels almost unusable. Nothing is where it is suppose to be or should be. Related items are in different categories. All options manage to feel to specific or to vague so I could next properly communicate what I wanted to. Icons such don't make any sense. Why is ""accident"" a plane crashing? Why is ""Need"" a man thinking of a toilet then only have religious stuff? Where even is the actual toilet option anyways? Why does ""play"" not have a computer or video game option? Why are the icons laid out in a such a confusing way? What is the color pallet suppose to mean? Why does shrinking the page shrink all the Icons and make everything even more unusable. Above all, i'd say the worst part is that some people are forced to communicate and rely on this thing. "
"The number of items on any one screen felt appropriate, but the total number of items on all the screens felt insufficient.","The lack of options as I drilled down into menus.  Short of typing all the words (which was an option) I felt the default vocabulary was sufficient for simple requests, but lack the depth for more detailed and complex thoughts and responses.","I could certainly ask for help with simple tasks, but for complex tasks I feel like I'd have to lean on the custom typing option too much","Yes, I'd be able to have a basic conversation, but it would be very slow.  It would depend on the patience of the other person.  I assume my speed would increase with better tool proficiency though.  Again, this would be restricted to simpler everyday topics,  and not complex technical discussions.",For me it took a lot longer than just typing a sentence.  One session isn't enough for me to get a feel if there would be a performance gain that was sufficient with increased proficiency.,Not finding words that'd you'd expect to find in certain sub-menus.  Was a little frustrating.  
It negatively affected my ability to communicate because of the large number of items,"The color grouping was helpful, but sometimes guessing which items may lay behind the quarter circle groupings was frustrating ",The help and question icons were clearly identifiable ,Some extraneous icons were either difficult to find or not present,The color grouping on the main page.,Some of the organization of the quarter circle sub tabs
"Since that's the first time using the tool, it's a lot to look through but as I got used to the tool and understood where words were, it became more useful. ","I would take time to look around to see if the word I wanted was in any of the sub categories, but if it took too long I ended up typing it myself","even if you can't find the word you need, you could always type it out","Personally, it communicating grow tedious after awhile and can take some time to get your phrase across (search for the letters, mistyping something, etc.)",It's relatively quick and the symbols help you to recognize which words mean what. ,"Not being able to find your specific word can be frustrating, especially when you're not sure what category it's in or exactly how the categories were laid out (such as insects and animals being under it)"
A little overwhelming at the start,"Difficult to find exact words, had to manually type most items.",Specific requests require typing but the general format of the sentence can be made with the pregenerated buttons,"I am not used to the tool, but it is slow and cumbersome. Plus there is no option to store custom words, so I would have to type the same thing over and over again by hand.",Pictures help with visually locating the relevant button or sub-group,My lack of knowledge of the tool and what would be classified under a particular heading. e.x. what goes under the give vs use headings.
