"Some things needed to be typed, but there were a lot of choices making it easy to communicate",The ease of usage enhanced my ability,"Anything that wasn't listed, could be typed so I could ask for anything I want",Easily used to express myself ,How easy it is to use,"The automated voice, could be humanized a little bit"
There were too many options. I would give up and just type answer,Not being able to find what I wanted fast enough. I just made everything short and sweet.,Help was easy to find,It takes a long time and people feel impatient,not have to use voice to communicate,hard to find options
"The number of items on the screen only affected my ability to communicate because I thought the questions that were asked were going to pertain to items on the screen. However, I actually had to type most of my words out. ","My preconceptions of the app. I thought I was going to be able to use the apps items on the screen fully to answer my questions, but had to use the key board. ","I would be able to use this tool to make a request because of the key board, and other items on the app. ",I would be able to use this tool to have a conversation because there are icons I can use for specific conversations and there is a key board for things I want to say that are not items on the app.,"The best thing about using the app to communicate is that the app has a key board for words that are not on the screen. Furthermore, I enjoyed just being able to click anywhere in the white space for the text box to reply fully. ",The worst thing about using the app is that I had to type out most of what I wanted to respond when asked questions.
The number of items affected my ability because some were folders for other items that to me didn't make sense all time. So I had to dig a lot and click may different buttons to try and find what I wanted to say. ,To me I wanted to make a full sentence so that they could understand me clearly and not have to form a sentence together in their head. But I struggled finding all the small words and not common terms in the items to use.,"I feel that asking help in general is a common question amongst students, but asking help with multiplying 2 numbers is not which is where I struggled with being specific. ","If you knew in an advance what your conversation was about, yes I would use this. But I took me so long to form a simple question at times that the conversation wouldn't be as engaging.","The pictures help give you an idea what it is saying without reading the word, so if you struggle figuring out the word the picture goes along with it giving you a visual.",It takes an extremely long time trying to get what you want said by clicking a number of buttons. The conversation wouldn't be too engaging. 
There were not enough options toward school related tasks ,The fact that when I was typing it said the letter or sounded out the word before I was finished and that got me off task. ,Because there was a help question and the key board. ,"Yes, but there is a lot of typing that is needed, so it makes the conversation take longer than it would with mostly pictures.","I think the folders was a really great idea to communicate, and the pictures made it easy to use and communicate. ","There was too much typing, I think it needs more pictures because some students don't know how to spell especially if the are in a moderate to intensive classroom. "
"At times it felt like there were too many items on the screen and it was difficult to find things. At other times, I liked how things were condensed into folders and it was relatively easy to navigate. ","Having the keyboard really enhanced my ability to express my thoughts. While pictures are great, sometimes I just wanted to use the keyboard and type my entire answer because that would've been more efficient than trying to find all the pictures I wanted to. ","Yes for the most part I could use this tool to ask for help, it gets challenging when you're asking for specific help. Like for a marker or eraser. I found every tool but either one of those.","I could have limited conversation, and it wouldn't flow well because of all the time it would take to find the words I wanted to say.","The best thing about using this app is being able to understand the thoughts of someone who has a difficult time speaking. A girls I worked with in high school used one and she could talk, but it was very difficult to understand her. However, when she used her tool which was similar, it was clear and I knew what she wanted. ","It was frustrating when I was looking for a word and couldn't find it. Like the word movie, or marker."
"It was challenging to find certain words or word categories.  It was stressful, because I felt like I was not answering fast enough.",Putting the words/word categories in alphabetical order,It would take too long for me to communicate that way.,It would take too long for me to be able to reply during a conversayion,The variety of words and word categories.,Difficulty navigating and finding words/word categories.
"Sometimes I was not sure where to look for a certain button. For example, I kept looking in the wrong spot for help. I also should have looked at all the button options before completing a sentence.","The Keyboard option was nice and when I couldn't find a button, I used the keyboard. I was limited from not knowing where to look for certain words. ","There are all the words needed to ask for help. For example: may, I, have, help ","Some words needed for easy communication were not there that I saw. Words like: My, specific animals, and some others that may be necessary. Again if I would have looked at all of the buttons first, I probably would've found more words.",It is nice that you can use the buttons individually as well as being able to form a sentence.,Not knowing the location of small connecting words or topic specific words.
There was a lot to look for. I think that if there was section for most commonly used that would be helpful such as bathroom,"It was hard for me to look at all of the items on the screen, I got distracted and sometimes overwhelmed by looking at them all",The help button was clear. Maybe there should be an icon at the top with needing help with the device ,I like that you are able to type if you cant find a word. i think that makes it personable ,I liked the photos that each icon had. I like that it speaks my sentence loudly when the bar is clicked. I was able to get my point across I also really enjoyed the typing feature. It was easier to communicate something super specific such as the breadstick question,the different colors and the number of icons kind of threw me off. It was also sometimes difficult to find the cue. for example when I clicked the help I was expecting it to be in the top left when I clicked the icon but it took me to a new screen and I found myself looking for it. I think it would be neat to have the voice that reads more human-like if that was possible. Other than that I enjoyed the device 
I was struggling trying to find the basic symbols and felt like I had to search different pages to find that specific one. ,"When asked specific questions based on my opinion, I felt like there wasn't symbols that were offered. It was easier when answering generic questions. ","I agree because once I remembered the items it was easier, but it was still difficult to find those unique last bits of information to complete that sentence to be able to be understood. ","It took a long time for me to find these symbols to represent my words. The conversation would take a very long time. I was able to have a very basic conversation, just not in detail. ","It is simple to use and very self explanitory, especially for little kids to use as well. ","It is generic and at times was frustrating to use because of the lack of words I was able to find in a decent time. I was able to type words out and would most likely use that over searching for symbols. 
"
My screen was large and I had to look around for the button I wanted. ,"I couldn’t use many words that make speech flow like “the, to, could” because I couldn’t find them quickly. ",I could but not without difficulty asking for what I really wanted. ,I would have to get a lot faster or the keyboard screen would have to be more like a smartphone to enable texting style typing. ,The keyboard option. ,Couldn’t find common use words. 
"As a first time user, it was difficult to sift through all icons, especially with more complex task demands. ","My incessant need to use prepositions and articles limited my ability. As a typical speaker, I found it difficult to filter out the extra junk in my language and condense to a basic subject and verb. ","With practice, I believe I could communicate most of my requests. ","Again, with practice. However, if someone plopped the tool in front of me right now and said I could only use it to communicate the rest of the day, I'd use the keyboard feature A LOT.",The keyboard feature allows literate persons to communicate almost anything. The fact that the tool was available by following a simple internet link makes the tool really accessible. Some AAC software costs a chunk of change and are not as mobile. ,"I don't know if it's a flaw so much as a necessary evil, but the number of folders and memorizing where icons are, etc. "
