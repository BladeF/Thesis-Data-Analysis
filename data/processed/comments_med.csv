I had trouble finding the basic structural words of a sentence.,"A lot of regularly used words were on the main page, however I feel that some words that weren't on the main screen were too difficult to find. The other things that limited my ability was that some categories for words didn't make any sense. ",When asking for help I would only respond vaguely because I  couldn't find the words that I needed.,I could use the tool but it would take way too long for me to type a sentence.,When the category tabs had words inside of them that made sense. ,There are too many images on the screen at one time. 
The number of items affected my ability because some were folders for other items that to me didn't make sense all time. So I had to dig a lot and click may different buttons to try and find what I wanted to say. ,To me I wanted to make a full sentence so that they could understand me clearly and not have to form a sentence together in their head. But I struggled finding all the small words and not common terms in the items to use.,"I feel that asking help in general is a common question amongst students, but asking help with multiplying 2 numbers is not which is where I struggled with being specific. ","If you knew in an advance what your conversation was about, yes I would use this. But I took me so long to form a simple question at times that the conversation wouldn't be as engaging.","The pictures help give you an idea what it is saying without reading the word, so if you struggle figuring out the word the picture goes along with it giving you a visual.",It takes an extremely long time trying to get what you want said by clicking a number of buttons. The conversation wouldn't be too engaging. 
"The number of items on any one screen felt appropriate, but the total number of items on all the screens felt insufficient.","The lack of options as I drilled down into menus.  Short of typing all the words (which was an option) I felt the default vocabulary was sufficient for simple requests, but lack the depth for more detailed and complex thoughts and responses.","I could certainly ask for help with simple tasks, but for complex tasks I feel like I'd have to lean on the custom typing option too much","Yes, I'd be able to have a basic conversation, but it would be very slow.  It would depend on the patience of the other person.  I assume my speed would increase with better tool proficiency though.  Again, this would be restricted to simpler everyday topics,  and not complex technical discussions.",For me it took a lot longer than just typing a sentence.  One session isn't enough for me to get a feel if there would be a performance gain that was sufficient with increased proficiency.,Not finding words that'd you'd expect to find in certain sub-menus.  Was a little frustrating.  
"Since that's the first time using the tool, it's a lot to look through but as I got used to the tool and understood where words were, it became more useful. ","I would take time to look around to see if the word I wanted was in any of the sub categories, but if it took too long I ended up typing it myself","even if you can't find the word you need, you could always type it out","Personally, it communicating grow tedious after awhile and can take some time to get your phrase across (search for the letters, mistyping something, etc.)",It's relatively quick and the symbols help you to recognize which words mean what. ,"Not being able to find your specific word can be frustrating, especially when you're not sure what category it's in or exactly how the categories were laid out (such as insects and animals being under it)"
My screen was large and I had to look around for the button I wanted. ,"I couldn’t use many words that make speech flow like “the, to, could” because I couldn’t find them quickly. ",I could but not without difficulty asking for what I really wanted. ,I would have to get a lot faster or the keyboard screen would have to be more like a smartphone to enable texting style typing. ,The keyboard option. ,Couldn’t find common use words. 
"As a first time user, it was difficult to sift through all icons, especially with more complex task demands. ","My incessant need to use prepositions and articles limited my ability. As a typical speaker, I found it difficult to filter out the extra junk in my language and condense to a basic subject and verb. ","With practice, I believe I could communicate most of my requests. ","Again, with practice. However, if someone plopped the tool in front of me right now and said I could only use it to communicate the rest of the day, I'd use the keyboard feature A LOT.",The keyboard feature allows literate persons to communicate almost anything. The fact that the tool was available by following a simple internet link makes the tool really accessible. Some AAC software costs a chunk of change and are not as mobile. ,"I don't know if it's a flaw so much as a necessary evil, but the number of folders and memorizing where icons are, etc. "
