However, I actually had to type most of my words out. ","There were too few items on the screen","I could communicate fully","My preconceptions of the app. I thought I was going to be able to use the apps items on the screen fully to answer my questions, but had to use the key board. ","5","I would be able to use this tool to make a request because of the key board, and other items on the app. ","5","I would be able to use this tool to have a conversation because there are icons I can use for specific conversations and there is a key board for things I want to say that are not items on the app.","The best thing about using the app to communicate is that the app has a key board for words that are not on the screen. Furthermore, I enjoyed just being able to click anywhere in the white space for the text box to reply fully.

So I had to dig a lot and click may different buttons to try and find what I wanted to say. ","There were too few items on the screen","I could communicate most of my thoughts","To me I wanted to make a full sentence so that they could understand me clearly and not have to form a sentence together in their head. But I struggled finding all the small words and not common terms in the items to use.","5","I feel that asking help in general is a common question amongst students, but asking help with multiplying 2 numbers is not which is where I struggled with being specific. ","4","If you knew in an advance what your conversation was about, yes I would use this. But I took me so long to form a simple question at times that the conversation wouldn't be as engaging.","The pictures help give you an idea what it is saying without reading the word, so if you struggle figuring out the word the picture goes along with it giving you a visual.","It takes an extremely long time trying to get what you want said by clicking a number of buttons.

"2020/04/08 1:10:30 PM AST","6","Computer Science","Fourth","3","5","To many options on screen, I felt overwhelmed constantly and throughout the duration of the test would discover new options I didn't realize existed such as the word ""this"". Furthermore, some words or concepts I felt could be in many places, such as ""snack"" could be under eat, need, or feel (as in I feel hungry). The amount of options made it harder to find what I needed. The color pattern system also was confusing, especially when different colors such as light yellow appeared in many places. If there are meant to be together, then they should be grouped together. I also mostly focused on the upper left hand side of the screen as this is where I thought most of the common and important functionality would be. Not finding the expected functionality where I needed it to be made me frustrated and made me feel more lost and confused.","There were too many items on the screen","I could communicate some of my thoughts","What limited my thoughts was just knowledge of the system, throughout the study I kept discovering and losing key items. Early on I commented on the system not having the word ""this"" until I found it later. At one point I found the word ""Zombie"" but was unable to find it again when looking to talk about movies. Some of the icons are either confusing or highly misleading. For example, need shows a man imagining a toilet yet there is no toilet option and almost all of the needs are related to religion. This complexity and confusing icons plus words not being in the right place made the software extremely hard to use. Given enough time, I could be able to learn the system better but I never feel that I could master it. ","2","Requests such as going to the bathroom and asking for help with math were almost impossible. This is in part due to the a fore mentioned confusing layout, my lack of knowledge with the system, I also don't believe some of these words exist within the system. After all this time I still have no idea where the word toilet or bathroom is, I can find toilet paper and Catheter just fine. While it is technically possible, this is incredibly frustrating to use and not preferable by any standard.","1","Conversations are extremely fragmented. It is hard to find action words and connect thoughts together. This leaves every sentence being disjoint and feeling broken. If I didn't have the prompt and just heard some of the lines I created, I would be deeply confused as to what point is being made.","It is better then using nothing or attempting to play charades every time you want something.","The entire thing feels almost unusable. Nothing is where it is suppose to be or should be. Related items are in different categories. All options manage to feel to specific or to vague so I could next properly communicate what I wanted to. Icons such don't make any sense. Why is ""accident"" a plane crashing? Why is ""Need"" a man thinking of a toilet then only have religious stuff? Where even is the actual toilet option anyways? Why does ""play"" not have a computer or video game option? Why are the icons laid out in a such a confusing way? What is the color pallet suppose to mean? Why does shrinking the page shrink all the Icons and make everything even more unusable. Above all, i'd say the worst part is that some people are forced to communicate and rely on this thing. "

","5","Because there was a help question and the key board. ","4","Yes, but there is a lot of typing that is needed, so it makes the conversation take longer than it would with mostly pictures.","I think the folders was a really great idea to communicate, and the pictures made it easy to use and communicate.

Short of typing all the words (which was an option) I felt the default vocabulary was sufficient for simple requests, but lack the depth for more detailed and complex thoughts and responses.","3","I could certainly ask for help with simple tasks, but for complex tasks I feel like I'd have to lean on the custom typing option too much","3","Yes, I'd be able to have a basic conversation, but it would be very slow.  It would depend on the patience of the other person.  I assume my speed would increase with better tool proficiency though.  Again, this would be restricted to simpler everyday topics,  and not complex technical discussions.","For me it took a lot longer than just typing a sentence.  One session isn't enough for me to get a feel if there would be a performance gain that was sufficient with increased proficiency.","Not finding words that'd you'd expect to find in certain sub-menus.

","The number of items on the screen was appropriate","I could communicate most of my thoughts","Having the keyboard really enhanced my ability to express my thoughts. While pictures are great, sometimes I just wanted to use the keyboard and type my entire answer because that would've been more efficient than trying to find all the pictures I wanted to. ","4","Yes for the most part I could use this tool to ask for help, it gets challenging when you're asking for specific help. Like for a marker or eraser. I found every tool but either one of those.","3","I could have limited conversation, and it wouldn't flow well because of all the time it would take to find the words I wanted to say.","The best thing about using this app is being able to understand the thoughts of someone who has a difficult time speaking. A girls I worked with in high school used one and she could talk, but it was very difficult to understand her. However, when she used her tool which was similar, it was clear and I knew what she wanted. ","It was frustrating when I was looking for a word and couldn't find it. Like the word movie, or marker."

I like that it speaks my sentence loudly when the bar is clicked. I was able to get my point across I also really enjoyed the typing feature. It was easier to communicate something super specific such as the breadstick question","the different colors and the number of icons kind of threw me off. It was also sometimes difficult to find the cue. for example when I clicked the help I was expecting it to be in the top left when I clicked the icon but it took me to a new screen and I found myself looking for it.

","It is simple to use and very self explanitory, especially for little kids to use as well. ","It is generic and at times was frustrating to use because of the lack of words I was able to find in a decent time.
